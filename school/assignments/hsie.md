personally i believe that Australia was both a way for those willing to put in the effort to have opportunities different than anywhere else on the world. and yet on the other hand incidents like the myall creek massacre and caledon bay crisis made it more and more difficult for those who weren't European to live in Australia, this being further shown by the (much) later white Australia policy and German prison camps. The conflict between the good and bad of Australia is like that of light and dark, You cant have on without the other, Australia is an amazing country now with a rich welcoming culture, but when you look back on the history its ridden with racism inhuman acts.

The gold rush was a period of time (1851â€“1890's) in which many immigrants came to get money and maybe even start a future here, many of these immigrants were coming from Asia, as such they had a different culture than the European culture that was already here at the time, because of this they faced major discrimination. One of the ways this is happened is that after the Europeans had finished mining an area, the immigrants would go over and pan the remaining dirt and scraps, finding what the Europeans had not, instead of understanding that it was on them for missing it they had continued, and even furthered their racism. One source depicts an Asian man drawn as a squid, tentacles wrapped around new issues, seemingly blaming them for everything that had been brought in at around the same time, even if it was the Europeans fault.
