(i did have the origional here, thats why i have the heading below)


re-written: (theme = reversal)

(they all walk in and talk the same as beforehand exept katherine and petruchio swap places/lines)

{petruchio}

Stop these unnessessary acts of pride and ego, they dig deeper than that of any dagger or knife ever could, cutting off the stem of the blossoming love.
i used to act the same, as if i had any worth above that of my partner, the conqueror of a vicious shrew, and yet it seems it had been the other way around, 
now wearing compassion as armour instead of dignity, i once believed that a husbands strength had to bend the will of his wife. And yet in strive to do exactly that, 
i had become undone, a mans command is nothing without a wife that respects and compromises with her own. For what is authority without mutuality.

I have learned that intellect and wit can rule any argument, glances more powerful than commands, silence heavier than speech. where i thought to speak, i was taught to listen
instead, where i thought to command i was taught to relax, within this relaxation i was able to stand, truly stand for love, it allowed me to see that was not the opposition, and certainly not something to hide from behind a wall of insecurity.

A husband may work, strive with blood sweat and tears, with the weight of the world on his shoulders to provide, yet there's still the lack of comfort without the warmth in his partners
heart, burning like a hearth freshly lit. He may look for obedience and ardor, yet what is either without love, just a seat yet to be filled by a wife, by *my* (idk how to do italics in here, using nvim) Katherine, I now receive a gift, a gift that has humbled, broken and tamed me, and yet without force, but by the honesty of truth, her truth.

It is truly a joke to think that the rest of you still believe yourselves stronger than your wives, your word is wood to a flame. Boasting about swords and armour, while they're able to 
turn it all to ashes and dust within a few words.

Priding yourself on victory while it was only the rest that you had gotten the previous night that allowed you such, nerves and anxiety being rung free from your consciousness the second you got onto that matress and got to truly relax, all in those clothes 
that she had cleaned just that same afternoon, for you owe everything to her, your heart, your soul, your victory, your respect and even obedience, true victory lies not in battle, but in your marrige.

I confess, for i am a changed man, Once i believed my word law and by will unshake-able, and yet she has left a mark on me, one seated with nothing but time and patience. Where i sought to taim, i have been tamed. i see now that this is no defeat, but a larger achievment than any other,i may have lost my ego and pride, but i gained humility and honor, within her strength, i found my own.

let no man Boast of domination over a woman, for the truth is gentler and far further profound, my hand is no longer above nor beneath hers, but side by side, as we are equals, 
equal in measure and equal in bond. if there be any taming here, then it is that of my own,  love has set me free, regardless of labels and she, once called shrew, has made me a better man.

now now dear, that was far much for a simple misunderstanding, wouldn't want you confusing them too much, now would we?

[petruchio nods before being brought closer by katherine and they walk out together]

[the others stay in shock, unable to understand what just happened]

i love adding the same stuff over and over to meet a wordcount because im somehow supposed to fit 300 words worth of speech into 500-700 words worth of essay.
