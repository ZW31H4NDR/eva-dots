The theme i had chosen for the assignment is that of reversing the roles of Petruchio and Katherine, This allowed for a more modern setting by the addition of removing gender roles and more power for the woman within the speech, given that the old one was based around that of abuse and "taming", I changed those to mutual respect, love and compromise between the pair. Not only are there are multiple examples that prove this littered throughout such as "my hand is no longer above nor beneath hers, but side by side, as we are equals", and, "a mans command is nothing without a wife that respects and compromises with her own", but also multiple different literary techniques to further push the speech, such as  a metaphor, "your word is wood to a flame". exaggeration, "with the weight of the world on his shoulders". and repetition, "when i thought to speak, i was taught to listen instead, where i thought to command i was taught to relax". All of that together goes to show that the original theme within Shakespeare's "taming of the shrew" is extremely outdated and poorly aged when compared to today's standards for relationships and expectancy for respect.
