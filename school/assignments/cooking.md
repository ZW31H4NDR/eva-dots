# design-brief

Create a food product that is eligible to be profitable for a movie cinema to sell in Goulburn, it must promote upcoming/new movies, and increase overall enjoyment of the experience.

# select an idea and outline why it is the most appropriate

the food that i have selected is the spider, a scoop of ice cream in a soft drink, i believe it is the most appropriate out of any of my other ideas because it is a well known and enjoyable snack/drink, they are also cheap to make given that its only three ingredients that are purchasable in bulk.

# describe your target market, explain why this has been chosen 

my target market is just people with a sweet tooth, its an easy market for a movie cinema given that if someone is going to buy food there despite the overly expensive prices, then they would be willing to purchase something else that contains both a drink and something to eat. Given the cheap price, its more likely to be brought on-top of other things too.
